  <h2> Tips </h2>
      

       <h2>Travel</h2>
<!--Paragrapgh starts here -->
      <p>
Follow these tips to reduce the time you spend driving:
Walk or bike when you can.  
Use the bike-share programs if your city or town has them.
Take public transit when possible.
Carpool with friends instead of driving alone.
Use ride-sharing services.
Plan ahead to make the most of your trips and “trip chain.” If your grocery store is near other places you need to visit, do it all at once.
Work from home periodically if your job allows it</p>

      <h2>Appliances</h2>

      <p>Appliances
Make energy efficiency a primary consideration when choosing a new furnace, air conditioning unit, dishwasher, or refrigerator. Products bearing the ENERGY STAR label are recognised for having superior efficiency.
Lighting
Turn off lights you’re not using and when you leave the room. Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact flourescent or LED ones.

      <h2>Food and Diet</h2>

<p>Eat locally-produced and organic food
It has been estimated that 13% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions result from the production and transport of food. Transporting food requires petroleum-based fuels, and many fertilizers are also fossil fuel-based.
Cut the beef and dairy
It takes a lot of resources to raise cows, and it’s especially bad if you buy beef from somewhere like Brazil, where it was grazed on land that used to be tropical forest but was cleared for agricultural use. Deforestation is a top contributor to carbon emissions and thus climate change.

 <h2>Lifestyle</h2>

<p>Reduce standby power consumption by taking the zero-volt challenge. Choose low energy-intensive activities (i.e., hiking vs. sky diving, kayaking vs. powerboats, electric vs. gasoline-powered yard equipment).
Choose green hotels and encourage hotels you visit to green theory.
